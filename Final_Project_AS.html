        <h1>The Cycle Of Hunger</h1>
         <img src= "The_Cycle_Of_Hunger.png">
        <p>One the world’s major problem is the global hunger. It been estimated that more than 700 million people suffer from hunger, because they can’t afford to buy food or don’t have access to food resources. Sounds crazy right? That’s the reality out there, or in better to say here. We can see hunger everywhere, even in the busiest and shiniest city in the whole world, New York City. When I walk around the street and see so many people on the street, my heart is bleeding. It is a basic need of human being, and without supplementing our system properly we can suffer from horrible diseases, and death. The work that published above demonstrate the cycle of hunger, while people throw almost %25 percent of edible food from their fridge, other people dig in any garbage only to settle their hunger. This cycle goes over and over in loops, when one asks for food from people who throw it away, then he finds it in the garbage with bacteria and many other disease.  
            The most interesting thing is that in 2020 there more than enough abundance of food to feed the whole world, yet it seems that isn’t solving the problem. Personally, I think that this most important fight the humanity will ever have, because no one needs to go to bed hungry. We need to fight for infostructures in any country that have no access to running water, agriculture, and food supply. It will never change if we won’t do anything about it. The world hunger kills everyday more people than any other virus out there, it’s fatal. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel, by a UN reports the world hunger has been decrease at the beginning of 2000 from %15 to %8 percent. Nations and leaders around the world put out a good fight, but we all must unite to stop it.
